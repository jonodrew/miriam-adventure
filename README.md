## HELP!

I've started writing an adventure game but I'm stuck and need your help. I've written some tests but I still need to
write code to make them pass - and other tests I've not even finished!

Could you:

- finish the tests
- add code so they all pass
- write tests for a new character (I have no idea, so you'll need to make something up!)
- and then write the character?

You should fork this repository by clicking on fork, and then clone the repository so you can work on it locally.

Don't forget to install pytest in your local virtual environment!
